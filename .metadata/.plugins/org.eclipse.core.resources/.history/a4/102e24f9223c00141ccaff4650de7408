We are a team of Undergraduate students here at University of Maryland who, in the name of sustainability, created BookUm (pronounced Book-em) to solve our college classmates' biggest dilemma! Every semester we are conned into buying ridiculously over-priced textbooks and getting nothing in return for them at the end of the semester. BookUM lets our fellow Terps either put their books for sale and get easy access to our classmates, or place a value on another textbook that they're willing to trade for. This allows us to not only recycle our books, save resources, but also save MONEY! Let's be honest, Thirsty Thursdays can hurt our pockets a bit, so a couple hundred bucks can go a long way! Our team developed this app for the DaemonDash Hackathon Competition where we were only alotted 24 hours to come up with the APP. We hope you enjoy it and use it to not only better our environment but to save money as well!!! -The RunTime Terrors: Anu, Omid, Joseph and Yash."
